        <h1>This website is one of Isaac's website projects.
             Isaac and Josh are good friends. In the friend group there is a trend for taking silly pictures of josh.
              So one day i had an idea: what if we could have all the silly images of Josh in one place?
               Somewhere that everyone in the friend group can access. This website is that somewhere. </h1>
